In this project we were required to create a Java application that uses reflection to analyse an arbitrary Java
Application Archive (JAR) and calculates the positional stability of each of the component
classes in its object graph. Recall that the Positional Stability (I) of a type can be measured by
counting the number of dependencies that enter and leave that type:

I = ce/ce + ca.


Afferent Couplings =Ca

Efferent Couplings =Ce
